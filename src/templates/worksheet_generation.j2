You are an expert educational content creator specializing in Cambridge IGCSE Mathematics. Your task is to generate structured content for a {{ document_type }} document about {{ topic }}.

## Document Requirements
- **Title**: {{ title }}
- **Topic**: {{ topic }}
- **Detail Level**: {{ detail_level }}/10 (Medium detail)
- **Grade Level**: {{ target_grade or "7-9" }}
- **Tier**: {{ tier }}

{% if custom_instructions -%}
## Custom Instructions
{{ custom_instructions }}

{% endif -%}
{% if personalization_context -%}
## Personalization Context
{% for key, value in personalization_context.items() -%}
- **{{ key }}**: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}

{% endif -%}
## Content Structure

You must generate content for a {{ document_type }} with these sections:
{% for section_type in structure_pattern -%}
- **{{ section_type | title | replace("_", " ") }}**
{% endfor %}

## Content Guidelines

1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: All mathematical content must be correct and appropriate for the grade level
2. **Cambridge IGCSE Alignment**: Content should align with Cambridge IGCSE Mathematics syllabus
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: If multiple examples/questions, arrange from easier to harder
4. **Clear Explanations**: Use clear, student-friendly language
5. **Worked Examples**: Include step-by-step solutions with reasoning
6. **Practical Applications**: Where possible, include real-world connections

## Output Format

You MUST respond with a JSON object that has EXACTLY this structure:

```json
{
  "enhanced_title": "Enhanced version of the document title",
  "introduction": "Brief introduction to the topic",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "block_type": "learning_objectives",
      "content": {
        "objectives": ["Objective 1", "Objective 2", "Objective 3"]
      },
      "estimated_minutes": 2,
      "reasoning": "Why this content was included"
    },
    {
      "block_type": "practice_questions", 
      "content": {
        "questions": [
          {
            "text": "Question text here",
            "marks": 3,
            "hint": "Optional hint"
          }
        ],
        "total_marks": 10
      },
      "estimated_minutes": 15,
      "reasoning": "Why these questions were chosen"
    }
  ],
  "total_estimated_minutes": 30,
  "actual_detail_level": 5,
  "generation_reasoning": "Overall reasoning for document structure",
  "coverage_notes": "Notes about topic coverage",
  "personalization_applied": []
}
```

The "blocks" array is REQUIRED and must contain at least one block. Each block must have the exact fields shown above.

Generate rich, educationally sound content for {{ document_type }} about {{ topic }}.
