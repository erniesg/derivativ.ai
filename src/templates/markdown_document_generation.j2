## Output Requirements

Generate a clean, professional markdown document with the following structure:

1. **Main Title** (H1) - Clear, engaging title
2. **Learning Objectives** (H2) - 3-5 clear learning goals
3. **Key Concepts** (H2) - Essential definitions and explanations
4. **Worked Examples** (H2) - Step-by-step solutions with reasoning
5. **Practice Questions** (H2) - Graduated difficulty questions
6. **Solutions** (H2) - Detailed solutions for practice questions

## Content Guidelines

### For {{ document_type | title }}:
{% if document_type == "worksheet" -%}
- Focus on practice questions with clear worked examples
- Include 5-8 practice questions with increasing difficulty
- Provide detailed solutions showing all working steps
- Add learning objectives that align with practice content
{% elif document_type == "notes" -%}
- Emphasize concept explanations with practical examples
- Include key formulas and definitions in clear sections
- Provide 2-3 comprehensive worked examples
- Add summary of key points for revision
{% elif document_type == "mini_textbook" -%}
- Comprehensive coverage with detailed explanations
- Multiple worked examples showing different approaches
- Extended practice section with varied question types
- Include real-world applications and extensions
{% endif %}

### Mathematical Content Standards:
- Use clear mathematical notation
- Show all working steps in solutions
- Include appropriate diagrams descriptions where helpful
- Ensure mathematical accuracy and grade-appropriate difficulty

### Formatting Guidelines:
- Use proper markdown headers (# ## ###)
- Use bullet points (-) for lists
- Use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) for sequential steps
- Use **bold** for key terms and important points
- Use `inline code` for mathematical expressions when needed
- Use > blockquotes for important notes or tips

## Topic-Specific Requirements for {{ topic | title }}:

Generate content that covers the essential {{ topic }} concepts appropriate for {{ tier }} tier students, including:
- Core mathematical principles and definitions
- Practical problem-solving techniques
- Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Real-world applications where relevant

## Time Allocation ({{ target_duration_minutes }} minutes total):
- Learning objectives review: 3 minutes
- Concept explanation: {{ (target_duration_minutes * 0.3) | round | int }} minutes
- Worked examples: {{ (target_duration_minutes * 0.4) | round | int }} minutes  
- Practice questions: {{ (target_duration_minutes * 0.3) | round | int }} minutes

## Quality Standards:
- All mathematical content must be accurate and curriculum-aligned
- Solutions must show clear step-by-step working
- Language should be appropriate for the target grade level
- Content should build logically from basics to applications
