# Pre-commit Hook Setup Complete

## What was installed:

1. **Pre-commit configuration** (.pre-commit-config.yaml):
   - **Ruff linting & formatting**: Fast Python linter and formatter
   - **Built-in hooks**: Trailing whitespace, end-of-file, YAML/JSON validation, merge conflict detection
   - **Unit tests**: Automatically runs `pytest tests/unit/` before each commit
   - **MyPy**: Type checking (commented out for faster commits)

2. **Ruff configuration** (pyproject.toml):
   - Modern Python linting rules (E, W, F, UP, B, SIM, I, N, C90, PL, RUF)
   - Reasonable ignores for test code and common patterns
   - Auto-formatting with consistent style

3. **Pytest integration**:
   - Unit tests must pass before commit
   - Fast feedback loop (only unit tests run)
   - Full test organization preserved in tests/ structure

## How it works:

- **Before each commit**: Automatically runs linting, formatting, and unit tests
- **Automatic fixes**: Ruff fixes most issues automatically
- **Fail-fast**: Commit blocked if unit tests fail
- **Performance**: Only runs unit tests (fast) during pre-commit

## Usage:

```bash
# Normal git workflow - pre-commit runs automatically
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"

# Manual pre-commit run
pre-commit run --all-files

# Skip pre-commit hooks (not recommended)
git commit -m "urgent fix" --no-verify

# Run specific test types manually
pytest tests/unit/ -v           # Fast unit tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v    # Integration tests
pytest tests/e2e/ -v           # End-to-end tests
```

## Benefits:

- **Code quality**: Consistent formatting and linting
- **Test reliability**: Unit tests must pass before commit
- **Fast feedback**: Catches issues immediately
- **Team consistency**: Same standards enforced for everyone
- **Production ready**: Best practices from day one

Pre-commit hooks are now active and will ensure code quality on every commit!
